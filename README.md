  # Functionality

  - So the concept here is to use the sign-in and sign-out buttons for state management. 
  - We have to fetch the data from API which provides usernames and passwords.
  - Now if the data that is entered doesn't match the data from the API throw the user  an Invalid Credentials div
  - If the data matches, log the user in and redirect to the home page.
  - If the user logs out of the website, make sure that he/she has no longer access to your home about and contact page.


  # Key points

  - UseStates for buttons, if the user clicks the signout button, redirect to the login page.
  - UseStates for a div that is only visible when user signs out in the login page.(Error message can be displayed here.)
